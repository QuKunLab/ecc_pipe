    input files updated by another job:
        all, circlemap_detect, circlemap_extra, samtools_sort
    missing output files:

    set of input files has changed since last execution:
        bwa_map
Some jobs were triggered by provenance information, see 'reason' section in the rule displays above.
If you prefer that only modification time is used to determine whether a job shall be executed, use the command line option '--rerun-triggers mtime' (also see --help).
If you are sure that a change for a certain output file (say, <outfile>) won't change the result (e.g. because you just changed the formatting of a script or environment definition), you can also wipe its metadata to skip such a trigger via 'snakemake --cleanup-metadata <outfile>'. 
Rules with provenance triggered jobs: bwa_map


This was a dry-run (flag -n). The order of jobs does not reflect the order of execution.

Reasons:
    (check individual jobs above for details)
    input files updated by another job:
        all, circlemap_detect, circlemap_extra, samtools_sort
    missing output files:
        bwa_map, circlemap_detect, circlemap_extra, samtools_sort
    set of input files has changed since last execution:
        bwa_map
Some jobs were triggered by provenance information, see 'reason' section in the rule displays above.
If you prefer that only modification time is used to determine whether a job shall be executed, use the command line option '--rerun-triggers mtime' (also see --help).
If you are sure that a change for a certain output file (say, <outfile>) won't change the result (e.g. because you just changed the formatting of a script or environment definition), you can also wipe its metadata to skip such a trigger via 'snakemake --cleanup-metadata <outfile>'. 
Rules with provenance triggered jobs: bwa_map


This was a dry-run (flag -n). The order of jobs does not reflect the order of execution.

Reasons:
    (check individual jobs above for details)
    code has changed since last execution:
        bwa_map
    input files updated by another job:
        all, circlemap_detect, circlemap_extra, samtools_sort
    missing output files:
        bwa_map, circlemap_detect, circlemap_extra, samtools_sort
Some jobs were triggered by provenance information, see 'reason' section in the rule displays above.
If you prefer that only modification time is used to determine whether a job shall be executed, use the command line option '--rerun-triggers mtime' (also see --help).
If you are sure that a change for a certain output file (say, <outfile>) won't change the result (e.g. because you just changed the formatting of a script or environment definition), you can also wipe its metadata to skip such a trigger via 'snakemake --cleanup-metadata <outfile>'.

    input files updated by another job:
        all, circlemap_detect, circlemap_extra, samtools_sort
    missing output files:
        circlemap_detect, circlemap_extra, samtools_sort
    set of input files has changed since last execution:
        bwa_map
Some jobs were triggered by provenance information, see 'reason' section in the rule displays above.
If you prefer that only modification time is used to determine whether a job shall be executed, use the command line option '--rerun-triggers mtime' (also see --help).
If you are sure that a change for a certain output file (say, <outfile>) won't change the result (e.g. because you just changed the formatting of a script or environment definition), you can also wipe its metadata to skip such a trigger via 'snakemake --cleanup-metadata <outfile>'.
