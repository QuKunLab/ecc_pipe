LockException:
Error: Directory cannot be locked. Please make sure that no other Snakemake process is trying to create the same files in the following directory:
/home/qukun/minghaofang/workspace/project/ecc/pipe/ecc_pipe
If you are sure that no other instances of snakemake are running on this directory, the remaining lock was likely caused by a kill signal or a power loss. It can be removed with the --unlock argument.
